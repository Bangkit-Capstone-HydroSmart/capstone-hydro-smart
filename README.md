Indonesia, primarily an agricultural nation, faces challenges due to land shortages, particularly in the agricultural sector. To address this, hydroponic cultivation emerges as a viable solution, requiring minimal space and maintenance efforts. However, awareness and knowledge about hydroponics remain limited among the populace. Hence, the HydroSmart application was developed to educate users on hydroponic principles, cultivation techniques, and maintenance. Through features like the Hydroponic Planting Guide and Plant Nutrient Calculator, users can optimize their hydroponic endeavors. The project stemmed from the team's observation of land constraints and the absence of comprehensive hydroponic resources. By providing a user-friendly platform, HydroSmart aims to enhance people's proficiency and interest in hydroponic cultivation, fostering healthier and more abundant plant growth.
